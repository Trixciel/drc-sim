This tool was made by Mema Haxx, it's used to stream the Wii U gamepad signal from the Wii U console to the PC, so you can use your PC as a "game controller" instead of the Wii U gamepad.
This tool is known to work with Linux, but I never got it to work with Windows.
It was modified by AboodXD to be at least usable with Python 3.4.
This is really useful, if your Wii U gamepad is broken, you can use your PC instead.

A demonstration can be seen here:

Here you can find an old version that is compatible with Python2.7:
