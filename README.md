# DRC Simulator

This tool was made by Mema Haxx, it's used to stream the Wii U gamepad signal from the Wii U console to the PC, so you can use your PC as a "gamepad".  
This tool is known to work with Linux, but I never got it to work with Windows.  
It was ported to Python 3 by AboodXD.  
This is really useful, if your Wii U gamepad is broken, you can use your PC instead.  
The only downside is that touch-screen is still unsupported. ;_;  
  
A demonstration can be seen here:

Here you can find an old version that is compatible with Python2.7:
